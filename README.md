# Coding Bat Python Solutions

These are the solutions I coded in Python for all exercises on [Coding Bat](<https://codingbat.com/python>)

I was introduced  to this site from the course
[Python Bootcamp](<https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-bootcamp/>
) in Udemy by Jose Portilla. 
It is actually really good.

I wrote two solutions for some exercises. There might be better solutions, feel free to comment or contribute.

# Help

Since this is my first approach to solving exercises with coding, I required some help. These are the resources I used:
* [Paul Miskew](<https://www.youtube.com/user/paulmiskew>) - Youtube Channel in Englis with solutions to some exercises
* [JPerry](<https://www.youtube.com/user/paulmiskew>) - Youtube Channel in Spanish with solutions to all exercises
* [@diezguerra](<https://github.com/diezguerra/codingbat-python-solutions>) - Saul's Github with solutions to all exercises

***If you can imagine it, you can code it!***
